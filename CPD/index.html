    <h4>Introduction to HTML</h4>
    <h5>What have I learnt?</h5>
    <p>How to implement tags and their uses for different styles, along with the importance of using HTML correctly when consdering accessibility for people with disabilties using a website. I learned about nested data, the importance of different headings & paragraphs, open and closed tags and various tags such as ordered lists (ol) & unordered lists (ul). I learned about forking and the pros of doing this.  </p>
    <h5>How did I use this in practice?</h5>
    <p>I used different tags in the body of a repository to style and list sentences. Used image & source tags. </p>
    <h5>What did I find hard?</h5>
    <p>I found the session easy to understand, my issue today was remembering to close tags correctly using the backslash. Other than this I found everything straightforward and I will ensure I check all closed tags thoroughly going forward. </p>

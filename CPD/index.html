    <h4>Introduction to HTML</h4>
    <h5>What have I learnt?</h5>
    <p>How to implement tags and their uses for different styles, along with the importance of using HTML correctly when consdering accessibility for people with disabilties using a website. I learned about nested data, the importance of different headings & paragraphs, open and closed tags and various tags such as ordered lists (ol) & unordered lists (ul). I learned about forking and the pros of doing this.  </p>
    <h5>How did I use this in practice?</h5>
    <p>I used different tags in the body of a repository to style and list sentences. Used image & source tags. </p>
    <h5>What did I find hard?</h5>
    <p>I found the session easy to understand, my issue today was remembering to close tags correctly using the backslash. Other than this I found everything straightforward and I will ensure I check all closed tags thoroughly going forward. </p>

    <h4>Introduction to CSS</h4>
    <h5>What have I learnt?</h5>
    <p>Learnt what CSS is and what it is in relation to HTML & Java Script - CSS is the second layer of a web page which is a presentation which is for presentation and layout.
     Touched on typeface basics, font-family & font size. 
      Box elements/ box models along with borders and margins. Learned about connecting CSS to a HTML document.
      It was interesting to learn about the hex colour picker and the resources for default browser font. 
        </p>
    <h5>How did I use this in practice?</h5>
    <p>I changed the background of my cloned google home page along with the font colour & size. </p>
    <h5>What did I find hard?</h5>
    <p>I do not think I got to grips with implementing containers therefore I am going to look into this in more depth in my own time before the next session on 11.05.21.  </p>

    <h4>More HTML & CSS </h4>
    <h5>What have I learnt?</h5>
    <p>From this session I learned about the importance of using CSS flex and how useful it is when positioning items in containers. Flex is a standard way of doing things in CSS when positioning items/ content.  Below I have added the notes I took from the session which gives an insight into the topics that were covered and my understanding of them. 
    <ol>LAYOUT</ol>
    <ol>Designing for different size screens </ol>
      <ol>Reactive was where you would have two versions of the website and when you made a request using the URL bar, request response etc your phone/laptop/device sends more info than just the web address we want to load it sends something called a MAC address which states what device its on/ the IP address the request is coming from
      So the person serving up the web address knows what device the person is on and knows which site to serve up 
      Issues with this is that there were two codes - sub domains etc 
      One code base would get updated while the other didn’t.
      Responsive is where media queries come into it. </ol>
    <ol>Progressive enhancement - mobile first - would relate the mobile site first and then figure out how to use the extra room.
      Graceful degradation - create the desktop version first and then figure out how to get it on to a mobile device / other device.
    </ol>
    <ol>Alex shows applying CSS to the body. Media works different - tell it max and min widths - min with means screens bigger than a certain size and max with means screens up to certain size - Media Queries - shows how changing the size if the screen the background colour changes depending on the CSS rule used. 
      Heights and widths can be changed dependant on the device person is using by applying media queries in the body using CSS. 
      Make sure all your data is in the correct order so that it works the way you want it too.
      Screen size and screen resolution -Desktop 1024 pixels width and above - 1024+, Tablet 1023 - 768, Mobile 767 – 320.    
      Page sizes -Width 1000px - length 570px.</ol>
      <ol>Above the fold - the part of the page that will appear before the user can scroll. The first thing the user/reader will see. 
      Inline styles is where you write the CSS directly into a style attribute on the HTML. 
      Anything that appears above the fold you should use in line styles for.
      Anything else that does not appear above the fold you should not use in line styles for.
      Everything else should be inside of an external style sheet - from a technical point of view everything should be inside of an external style sheet. 
      The average user for a normal web page is willing to wait 2.5 seconds for a page to load - 53% of people that use google chrome.
      If you have done inline styles on your document, your browser will render that before it goes off to look for the other stuff, this matters is because my browser can show them a bit of the page that looks like it’s loaded. - This stops people from leaving as they will not realise the full page that’s not yet loaded - useful if using web servers that are not so fast when starting out.</ol>
      <ol>CSS flexbox </ol>
      <ol>The flexbox layout was created to provide a more efficient way to layout, align and distribute spacing among items in a container, even when their sizing is unknown and/ or dynamic (thus the word ‘flex’). 
      </ol>
      <ol>There is CSS specific to flexbox. 
      Once a parent element has been told to display flex, you have a container, inside of the container you have items, you can then tell the items if they need to be specific widths etc. You have cross axis and a main axis, a main size and a cross size.
      CSS before flexbox meant everything just stacked on top of itself in html, CSS with flexbox - containers can be displayed next to one another. </ol> 
        </p>
    <h5>How did I use this in practice?</h5>
    <p>I completed task 9 & 10 to change the position of the wording on the cloned google home page. Other than this I have not put what I have learnt into practice.
      I am going to practice flexbox using flexbox froggy before the final module 2 session. </p>
    <h5>What did I find hard?</h5>
    <p>I did not find anything hard in this session yet I am sure I will get stuck once I begin to put what I have learned into practice.    </p>

    <h4>Finishing up HTML and CSS</h4>
    <h5>What have I learnt?</h5>
    <p>I learnt the importance of testing the code I had written by viewing it on the live screen prior to committing it on GitHub desktop and pushing it. 
      CSS reset was covered in this session. This is used to give the best chance of a webpage looking the same on all browsers as it removes all default settings from a browser. CSS reset goes at the top of style sheet.
      I learnt how to add a header, images and a footer to a webpage. Used Flexbox to evenly space the items on the page. Learnt how to input containers on the page.      
        </p>

    <h5>What did I find hard?</h5>
    <p>Whilst adding the code for the photography webpage I had to go back and debug the code a few times as the images were not showing as they were meant to at first. 
      I still have to reassess the images on the page as I do not think I wrapped these as intended as they are still showing as different sizes. 
      I will need to attend a drop-in session prior to this page being needed for a JavaScript session.   </p>

    <h4>Intro. to JavaScript</h4>
    <h5>What have I learnt?</h5>
    <p> I was provided with a more in-depth insight into what JavaScript does, why and how.
       Also touched on the importance of pseudocode. Again, I have added the notes I made during the session to show what I understood/ took from the session. 
      <ol> How do computers fit in with the world around us? </ol>
Objects contains data, object could be a person and the variables could be colour-brown, jumper-blue etc. 
Events are things that can happen- often referred to as triggers. Event triggers functions.  
Events could be when the mouse double clicks something on the page and an event occurs, hovers over something and something happens. 
JavaScript language has native types of objects. 
In JavaScript – an Array can only have numbers as keys.
<ol> The DOM – Document Object Model </ol> 
How a browser sees a webpage: 
-	Receives a page as HTML code first – Each page on a website can be seen as a separate document. 
-	Create a model of the page and store it in memory – this is called DOM 
-	Use a rendering engine to show the page on the screen – there is no CSS at this stage 

<ol> What is JavaScript? What it can do, and using it with HTML </ol>  
JavaScript is NOT JAVA. 
It is a Client Side scripting language. 
It works in your browser and most recently works on servers.
HTML is the first layer of a web page – describes and provides structure.
CSS is the second layer of a web page which is for presentation and layout. 
JavaScript is the third layer of a web page which is for functionality. 
What can JS do? Anything active, anything that changes, if you do something and something else happens, that’s JS. Dropdown boxes/ carousels. Lightboxes/modals. Drawing/ animation. Track users and hold data with cookies. 
Cookies are little bits of data that are stored on your device so that it makes it easier to log in next time basically. Cookies have a shelf life. Cookies are useful.  
Not tracking not kept on cookies. 

<ol> Pseudocode </ol>   
Pseudocode – helps with algorithms. 
Set of instructions and guidance as to what the programme needs to do. Pseudocode is blueprints essentially. 
When you write pseudocode you capitalise the instruction.
You write the programme out in statements – You can then convert that into code very quickly. 
More likely to land a job if you use and logically write pseudocode. You can debug pseudocode very quickly. Very useful.
Coding jobs – often a test. Most people run out of time in the tests when writing the code, however if you have written out the pseudocode first, you have shown your plan for writing the code. 
Pseudocode specifically breaks down each command. 
It is important that we give specific instructions, every little detail is needed. We cannot rely on assumed knowledge when using commands.
<ol> Misc. </ol>  
A string is a collection of characters 
Booleans are true or false 
An empty string is false. Zero is false. an undefined variable and a variable with null is false. 
NaN – Not a number – returns as false 

        </p>
    <h5>How did I use this in practice?</h5>
    <p>I added text notes into the console on my live page. </p>
    <h5>What did I find hard?</h5>
    <p>My device logged me out of the session as variables were being covered so I am now unsure on this aspect.
      I plan to rewatch this section until I understand variables fully.    </p>
